# Top 10 Scenario-Based Questions for GCP Cloud Associate Exam

This README provides 10 scenario-based questions reflecting real-world situations you might encounter on the Google Cloud Associate Cloud Engineer exam.

---

## 1. Multi-Region Storage Requirements

**Scenario**:  
Your company needs to store critical customer data that must be accessible across multiple regions with the highest durability and availability.

**Question**:  
Which storage class would you recommend and why?

**Answer**:  
I recommend **Google Cloud Storage with the Multi-Regional storage class**. It provides **99.999999999% durability** and **99.95% availability** by replicating data across multiple regions. This makes it ideal for frequently accessed, business-critical data that needs geographic redundancy.

---

## 2. Cost-Effective VM Deployment

**Scenario**:  
Your development team needs to run non-production workloads that can be interrupted without affecting business operations.

**Question**:  
What type of VM instances would you recommend to minimize costs?

**Answer**:  
Use **Preemptible VMs**. They are significantly cheaper (up to **80% less**) than standard instances but can be terminated by Google with a 30-second notice if resources are needed elsewhere. Since these are non-production workloads that can handle interruptions, preemptible VMs offer substantial cost savings.

---

## 3. Network Security Implementation

**Scenario**:  
Your organization wants to secure communication between services running in different subnets within the same VPC.

**Question**:  
What would you implement to control traffic between these services?

**Answer**:  
Implement **VPC firewall rules**. You can create rules that allow or deny traffic between resources in different subnets based on IP ranges, protocols, and ports. For more granular control, you could also use **service accounts** in your firewall rules to specify which services can communicate with each other.

---

## 4. Auto Scaling Web Application

**Scenario**:  
Your team has deployed a web application on **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)** that experiences unpredictable traffic spikes.

**Question**:  
How would you configure the application to handle these traffic variations efficiently?

**Answer**:  
Implement **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)** in GKE based on CPU utilization or custom metrics. Set appropriate minimum and maximum replica counts, and configure the autoscaling policy to **scale out quickly** during traffic spikes and **scale in gradually** during traffic decreases. Additionally, consider using **cluster autoscaling** to automatically adjust the number of nodes in your GKE cluster based on pod requirements.

---

## 5. Disaster Recovery Planning

**Scenario**:  
Your company requires a disaster recovery solution that can recover critical applications within **4 hours** with minimal data loss.

**Question**:  
What GCP services and configurations would you recommend?

**Answer**:  
Implement a **warm disaster recovery** setup using **regional persistent disks** for database storage with regular snapshots. Use **Cloud DNS** with failover routing policies to redirect traffic to the secondary region when needed. Set up **Cloud Monitoring** with appropriate alerting to detect failures quickly. Use **Deployment Manager** or **Terraform** templates to automate the recovery process, ensuring **Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of less than 4 hours**. For minimal data loss, implement **synchronous database replication** between regions.

---

## 6. Log Management Strategy

**Scenario**:  
Your security team needs to retain application logs for compliance purposes for **3 years**, but they need quick access only to the **last 30 days** of logs.

**Question**:  
What logging strategy would you implement in GCP?

**Answer**:  
Use **Cloud Logging** for collecting and analyzing recent logs. Create **log sinks** to export all logs to **Cloud Storage** with **lifecycle management policies** that:

- Transition logs older than **30 days** to **Coldline storage**.
- Transition logs older than **365 days** to **Archive storage**.

This approach provides quick access to recent logs while cost-effectively storing older logs for compliance requirements.

---

## 7. Private API Access

**Scenario**:  
Your team has developed internal APIs that should only be accessible by authorized services within your GCP organization, not from the public internet.

**Question**:  
How would you secure these APIs?

**Answer**:  
Deploy the APIs on **Cloud Run** or **GKE** with **internal load balancers**. Use **VPC Service Controls** to create a service perimeter around your APIs. Implement **Private Service Connect** to allow authorized services to access the APIs without exposure to the internet. Use **IAM** for authentication and authorization to ensure only authorized service accounts can access the APIs.

---

## 8. Database Migration

**Scenario**:  
Your company is migrating from an on-premises **MySQL** database to GCP and requires minimal downtime.

**Question**:  
What approach and tools would you use for this migration?

**Answer**:  
Use **Database Migration Service (DMS)** for MySQL to handle the migration with minimal downtime. Set up **continuous data replication** from the source database to **Cloud SQL for MySQL**. Once the initial data is synchronized, validate the data integrity and application compatibility with the new database. Finally, schedule a brief maintenance window to switch the application connection strings to point to the **Cloud SQL** instance and complete the cutover.

---

## 9. Cost Optimization

## 10. Secure Access to Google Cloud Resources

**Scenario**:  
Your organization requires that all access to GCP resources must use corporate identity management, enforce multi-factor authentication, and follow the principle of least privilege.

**Question**:  
How would you configure access management to meet these requirements?

**Answer**:  
Implement the following:

- Set up **Cloud Identity** or **Google Workspace** and federate it with your corporate identity provider (IdP) using **SAML**.
- Enable **2-Step Verification** for all users.
- Use **Cloud IAM** to implement role-based access control (**RBAC**) with **custom roles** that provide only the necessary permissions for each job function.
- Implement **IAM Conditions** to restrict access based on factors such as time, date, and originating IP address.
- Use **Policy Intelligence** tools like **IAM Recommender** to regularly review and refine permissions.
